ACEPT - Automated, communal energy planning tool
================================================

ACEPT is an open-source project that aims to provide an automated, communal energy planning tool. 

It allows users to model and analyze energy demand, supply, and distribution in a community or urban area. 
The tool takes into account factors such as building characteristics, regional data, and renewable energy 
sources to help users to generate energy planning scenarios and evaluate their impact on sustainability and 
cost-effectiveness.

Welcome to the documentation for the ACEPT project. Check out the project on :octicon:`mark-github;1em;fa fa-github` `GitHub <https://github.com/VeraKowalczuk/acept>`_.
